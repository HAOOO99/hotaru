## As A Developer

### Find A Bug

If you detected some bugs in the code or unexpected results while using the app, you can nominate it in Issue by adding the **bug** tag at it. You are of course welcomed to try to fix it yourself, and you can contribute by merging it to the `main` branch via creating a pull request.

### New features

If you have an idea in mind that might be an interesting feature for Hotaru, you can also nominate it in Issue by adding the **enhancement** tag. The maintainers will review it, and it might be developed and launched in future versions. We would also encourage you to try to develop it yourselves, and you can can contribute by merging it to the `main` branch via creating a pull request.

### Write Documents

If you find any flaws in some existing documents, you can fix it in your own branch and create a pull request. We would appreciate it if you can make sure that your pull request's title starts with **\[doc\]**.

## As A CCL Learner

`Don't worry, you don't have to know how to code to make contributions.`

### New features

You might find some difficulties while using Hotaru, don't just take it for granted! We would appreciate it if you can nominate it in the Issue board.

It doesn't have to be very professional, and our developers might contact you if we find your idea is interesting, and worth developing.
