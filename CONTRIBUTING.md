### Find A Bug

You might find some difficulties while using Hotaru, don't just take it for granted! We would appreciate it if you can nominate it in the Issue board.

We would appreciate it if you could attach some more images or video to better describe your delima, so it would be easier for our developers to fix them.

### New features
