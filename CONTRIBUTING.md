# Contributing to Hotaru

As an open source CCL training tool, Hotaru welcomes all the CCL learners and developers to contribute to the community.

## As A Developer

### Find A Bug

If you detected some bugs in the code or unexpected results while using the app, you can nominate it in Issue by adding the **bug** tag at it. You are of course welcomed to try to fix it yourself, and you can contribute by merging it to the `main` branch via creating a pull request.

### New features

If you have an idea in mind that might be an interesting feature for Hotaru, you can also nominate it in Issue by adding the **enhancement** tag. The maintainers will review it, and it might be developed and launched in future versions. We would also encourage you to try to develop it yourselves, and you can can contribute by merging it to the `main` branch via creating a pull request.
